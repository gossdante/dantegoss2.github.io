This is my website. I'm a Kinesiology PhD student interested in using wearable sensors to improve health outcomes and increase physical activity with age.
My academic research is focused on gait retraining, I am currently measuring the effects it has on lower body joint loading and the metabolic cost of walking.
I'm a data nerd and can often be found piloting or tinkering in Python, R, or Matlab.
